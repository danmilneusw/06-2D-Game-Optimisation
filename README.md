## Summary
- Apply texture compression and monitor its impact using the Memory Profiler and the Profile Analyzer.
- Apply culling into a 2D game.
- Get additional tips on using the Memory Profiler and Profile Analyzer.

## Tutorial
1. Open **Unity Project - 2D**.
2. Firstly, a quick sidenote: One thing you might notice is that if you fire your projectile outside of the map, it will never hit anything and never be destroyed. Look below, the hierarchy is full of projectiles. Like in [last week's tutorial](https://github.com/danmilneusw/05-Garbage-Collection/), these projectiles could certainly be put in an object pool; when they haven't hit anything after a certain amount of time, they should be deactivated using [SetActive](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SetActive.html) = False and reactivated using SetActive = True when the player fires a projectile again.
